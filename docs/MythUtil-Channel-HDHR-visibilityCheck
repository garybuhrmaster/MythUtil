Requirements:  Only tested with MythTV 0.28, and recent
HDHR3-CC firmware.  It is unknown if it will work with previous
revisions.  To insure that the channel map in the HDHR3-CC
is correct you will need to run a "Detect Channels" from the
HDHR3-CC web page.  The device will run background scans
at future intervals to (attempt) to keep the maps accurate,
but large changes (such as the proposed MCLU rollout) may
require explicit re-scans.

Usual cavets:  This program (optionally) updates your MythTV
database.  While it uses the Services API, one should be sure
to have a proper backup in case it updates things in ways you
did not intend.

Note that the Services API itself does not currently have the
ability for force a master backend reschedule.  If you care
about an immediate update, you should likely run
'mythbackend --resched' after this program (for many use
cases, the next guide load will perform the needed resched).

For the examples below, it is presumed you are running on the
backend host with the default ports and the sourceid of your
cable lineup is 1.

Scenario:

You simply want a report on what channels are set differently
in MythTV as what you CableCARD indicates you can record,
and if your MythTV channel and CableCARD channels are
different.

   MythUtil-Channel-HDHR-visibilityCheck --hdhr=myhdhr.local --videosource-id=1

Scenario:

You want to set the MythTV channel visibility to be the same as your
CableCARD subscriptions.

   MythUtil-Channel-HDHR-visibilityCheck --hdhr=myhdhr.local --videosource-name=FiOS --update

Scenario:

You have both a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD to record unprotected
content and a STB to record protected content (say ShowTime) with
a dedicated lineup (sourceid) that you use for the STB (because of the
capability of recording protected content).  Occasionally your provider has
a "free" premium channel weekend for Starz which will still be marked
as protected (so you need to use your STB to record it), but will be added
to your CableCARD channel enablements for the "free" weekend.  For this
example, your Starz channel is 500 and your STB lineup is sourceid=2

   MythUtil-Channel-HDHR-visibilityCheck --hdhr=myhdhr.local --videosource-id=2 --channel=500 --ignore-copy-protection --update
